SEATTLE 1988




Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.

Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.




(screams)
Oough! Ahhh!

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
(to others)
Upstairs.

Troops pour into the house.


What's going on? What's the matter?
Who are you?

The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue
entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles
ready.


Hey!

Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops
descend on a bedroom.


(off camera)
Dade! Dade!


Knock it down.

The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.




The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing
argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.


The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly
committed criminal acts of a malicious
nature. This defendant possesses a
superior intelligence, which he uses to a
destructive and antisocial end. His
computer virus crashed one thousand five
hundred and seven computer systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,
single handedly causing a seven point drop
in the New York Stock Market.

As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning
down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade
Murphy.

Fast forward to the sentencing.


Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
forty-five thousand dollars...

The court gasps, Dade's father winces


...and sentence you to probation, under
which you are forbidden to own or operate
a computer or touch tone telephone, until
the day of your eighteenth birthday.

Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.

Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.




SEVEN YEARS LATER.




Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the
aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a
direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,
which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The
title logo.



Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors
and at night, working on his new computer. His mother
calls him.


(off camera)
Dade?


Yeah, mom?


What are you doing?


(after a semi-pregnant pause)
I'm taking over a TV network.


Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy
birthday.



In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a
man answers nervously.


Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.


Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from
Accounting. I just had a power surge here at
home that wiped out a file I was working on.
Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know
anything about computers?


Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...


Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just
went AWOL, and I've got this big project due
tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get
it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari
Kari...


Uhhh.. ahahaha...


Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management
techniques.
(pause)
Could you, uh, read me the number on the
modem?


Uhhhmm...


It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches
on it... lets my computer talk to the one
there...


212-555-4240.

Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry
of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.
He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback
System. There is a graphic representation of the
station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his
TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
type TV show.


(on TV)
...so-called American Indians, Latinos and
Blacks come from a genetically mediocre
stock...


Yak yak yak. Get a job!

Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer
diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm
selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
tapes.  The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and
is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade
watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.


You are about to experience the awe and
mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,
to... The Outer Limits.


Yesssss!

Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
message:

U HAVE TREAD
UPON MY DOMAIN &
MUST NOW SUFFER
WHO R U?


Hey! What?

He starts to type ZERO...


No, wait.

Dade types:

CRASH OVERRIDE.
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

Dade's screen dissolves into:

ACID BURN


Unbelievable. A hacker!

Then the screen changes again:

ACID BURN
SEZ LEAVE B 4
U R EXPUNGED

"The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.


Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.

Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The
tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes
fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps
changing.

The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:

I WILL
SWAT U LIKE
THE FLY U R

More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.
Another message.

I WILL
SNAP YOUR BACK
LIKE A TOOTHPICK

As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:

MESS WITH THE BEST
DIE LIKE THE REST

One last from Acid Burn:

YOU ARE


Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
is terminated.


Shit on me!



Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges
from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging
moving boxes) for the fridge.


Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?


Mm-hmm.


Up all night again, huh?


Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
please?

Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the
building superintendent.


Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll
sleep normal hours? He's been playing with
his computer all night for a solid week.
(pause)
Well yes, he could be playing with himself.
Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,
don't you?


Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as
charming as you yet.


You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,
Dade?
(louder)
Right, Dade?!


Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!

Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks
his room. Dade is showering.


(angry, through the bathroom door)
You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up
again and you won't get into college!

She pauses and regains some of her cool.


I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
I didn't want to sell the house but I had to
take this new job, you know that. You're
going to love New York, it's the city that
never sleeps!




We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.



At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.


Excuse me.


Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.


Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
principal's office.


Sorry, I can't help you, okay?

Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
office.




Dade is filling out a form.


Do you have your transfer forms?

Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.


It's a relatively straightforward question.

Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
all involving lips and kissing.


Do you speak English?


Sorry, you wanted...?


I wanted transfer forms.

He gives them to her.


Thank you.

She starts leaving. He doesn't.


Are you coming?

Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
a brief tour.




The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
through there.


Great. Cool.
(pause)
What's your name?


Kate. Kate Libby.

They arrive at a classroom.


Here's your class.


My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?


No, you're not in my class.

Kate starts away.


Give me time!

A guy in the halls notices Dade.


Hey, you new?


Yeah.


Tell him about the pool, Kate.


Pool?


Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
on the roof. Take the stairs over there.


Yeah! Sure.

Kate starts away again.


Thanks!




Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
One of them notices Dade.


Hey! Hold the door!

He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.

Dade
(realizing he's been had)
No pool.

Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
raining.




Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates
leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls
through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled
in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.


Oh my God! He found the pool.



The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade
is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to
Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing
skeletons.


I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.
Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur
rally. I know some of you kids got computers
at home. But these are school property,
people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck
to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
interface...

Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been
looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking
himself into her advanced English class.



It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.


So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,
eh? Academic? Purely sexual?


Homicidal?


What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!

The name rings no bells with Dade.


The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
know you play the game.

Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.


Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,
dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...


(slaps Joey)
Joey, Joey...


What? whatwhatwhat?


One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap
the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to
save you from yourself but you gotta stop
letting your mama dress you, man!
(To Dade):
Check it...

Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.


(interrupting)
I need a handle, man. I don't have an
identity until I have a handle.


You know, you're right about that.
(to Dade)
Check it, Friday.

Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.


Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,
huh?


You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.

Phreak walks away.


Ultra Laser.
(desperate)
Doctor Doom!



Dade rolls in on rollerblades.  Street vendors hawk
computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
vendor catches Dade's attention.


Check this out, each and every one of you.
Compilation tape, of my own making. I call
this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring
artists like, well I got some Hendrix on
there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all
great artists that asphyxiated on their own
vomit!

The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.


Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!

Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
video game with a huge screen.  Phreak is at a pay phone.


(on phone)
Please deposit five dollars for the first
minute.

Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
button, and the box emits a series of tones.


Thank you.


Nonono, thank YOU!

Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
top-10 list.


That's a nice score for a girl.


(irritated by Dade's presence)
Think you can do better?


I'll give it a shot.

Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
above.


Is this kid bothering you, Kate?


Sorry, can I get some room here?


Yeah.
(to Kate)
Why don't you come up here?

Kate obliges and joins Curtis.  Dade continues playing.
He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
high score is about to come up.


He's good!

Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
is amazed.


(to Kate)
Well, it looks like I'm on top.

Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.


Congratulations. No one's ever beat her
before. You just made an enemy for life.
(to someone else)
Boy meets world. Let's go?



Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
little disgusted.


Who's that?


Curtis.


And what's he do?


That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
slick all day.

Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
speeds off into the night.



The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.



Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.


What's up?

Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
realizes what is happening.


(amused and highly impressed)
Oh my God. You...

A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
face.


Way cool!
(to Dade)
You saw that?

Dade nods in the affirmative.

Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has
happened.


What the hell is going on?


Pool on the roof must have a leak.

Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.

Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.


Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.



Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on
the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.


If God gave men brains bigger than dogs',
they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail
parties.

The class giggles.


Ruth Libby.


I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a
significant author of the twentieth century.


Her last book sold two million copies.


(almost in unison)
Woooooo!

The teacher reads Dade's quotation.


"Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient
heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in
the machinery of the night."


That's Ginsburg.


Nice. Very nice.


He's not in this class.


I said give me time.


He's not enrolled in this class.


Well, he's on my list.

Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the
teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy
look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher
moves on to Cereal.


"Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind
the most?"


Ozzy Osbourne!


You. What is your name?

The teacher grabs the list back from Kate.


Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?


You, however, are not on my list.


(in mock shock)
Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?

The class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the
teacher escorts Cereal to the door.




How was school?


(eating)
Hmmm.


What did we learn in school today?


Revenge.


Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?


No. No one special.


Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be
home late.  And would you try and please fill
these out?

She indicates a pile of college applications.


Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your
life.

She starts to the door.


Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the
lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.


And unpack.

She leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for
a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this
now.




Dade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is
giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter
Cereal.


FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do
like absolutely nothing and...

Cereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met
formally but seen around, and then continues.


...and your name goes through like seventeen
computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's
a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living
large. We have no names, man, no names. We
are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.


Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But
he does know things.

Dade and Cereal acknowledge each other.


Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me.
I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking
around...


(to Cereal)
D'you bring those Crayola books?


Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.

Cereal brings a book out of his bag.


Green one.


What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What
are these?


International Unix Environments.

Cereal pulls out another book.


Luscious orange?

Cereal hands the orange book to Phreak.


Computer security criteria, DOD standards.

Another book comes out.


The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So
called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy
wears on the cover.

Another one.


What's that?


Devil book. The Unix Bible.

Another one.


What's that?


Dragon book. Compiler design.

Cereal brings out a large red book.


Oh yeah? What's that?


The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks.
Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that
won't fit on a shelf.

By now Phreak has made a pile of the books, and the Red
Book looks wholly out of place on the top of the pile.


Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm
in this computer, right. So I'm looking
around, looking around, you know, throwing
commands at it, I don't know where it is or
what it does or anything. It's like, it's
like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like
four hours I'm just messing around in there.
Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.
Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this
morning, I look in the paper, some cash
machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out
seven hundred dollars into the middle of the
street.


That's kinda cool.


That was me. That was me. I did that.


You did this from your house.

Joey takes a drag from his cigarette and just nods, with a
big grin on his face.


What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't
hack a bank across state lines from your
house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where
are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know
anything?


Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.


You guys always think I should know
everything, and you never tell me anything.
Am I right?


Alright, what are the three most commonly used
passwords?


Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that
order, necessarily, right?


Yeah but don't forget God. System operators
love to use God. It's that whole male ego
thing.


Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.


Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
and look for oil and stuff?


Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
big iron?


Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
low security, and try the back door.


Yeah but oh man,
(starts rubbing one of his
own nipples in mock sexual
excitement)
wouldn't you just love to get one of those
Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!


Yo, who ate all of my fries?

Cereal pauses a second.


(pretending to be enraged)
Joey?!


What, no, nonononono, I didn't touch your
fries. I did not touch your fries.


Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.


It was him, man!


You're psyched. You need to lay off of that
shit.


(to Joey)
I'm gonna hit you!





Joey is hacking. A Gibson. He gets in. Using GOD as a
password. Nice graphics represent the machine's vast
systems.


YES! Home run, home run. You and me Lucy.
We're gonna show em baby.



A system operator at Ellingson Mineral Corporation, a
large oil company, notices the intrusion. He gets on the
phone.



The place is a mess, typical of the hacker bachelor pad.
Empty chinese food boxes and Jolt Cola cans litter the
place.

Plague's phone is ringing, waking him.


(on phone)
Mr. Belford?


(sleepily)
My name is the Plague.


Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's
happening on the net.


As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?


Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson
is working really hard. We got one person
online, the workload is enough for like ten
users. I think we've got a hacker.




Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here.
Right, uh...

Joey starts looking for something to download as proof he
was there.


Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.

He selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His
screen becomes a psychedelic mind trip.



The Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin,
bearded, about 35 but still trying to be a teenage
anarchist, yet not consciously realizing he sold out that
ideal years ago.


Never fear. I is here.


I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.


Let's echo 23, see what's up.

The huge monitor lights up with the display of the
Gibson's resources. Hal and the Plague watch. Plague
starts "surfing" around.


"God" wouldn't be up this late.

He sees what Joey is downloading. A file called
"Garbage".


Shit! Get me the switching control center.

He puts on a telephone headset. Hal dials for him.


(into the headset)
I need to trace a call that's in progress.



Joey is sneaking a cigarette while his computer downloads.
There is a knock at the door. It's his mother.


(whispering)
Shit!
(loudly, panicked)
Uh yeah... hold on, mom. Hold on one second.

He puts out the cigarette and sprays the room with air
freshener.

JOEY'S MOM
I mean it! Open the door, Joseph.


Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.

He unlocks the door. Joey's mom bursts in. He's still
clambering into bed.


There you go.

JOEY'S MOM
Bed. Sleep. Now!

She turns off the computer. It wasn't finished
downloading.

JOEY'S MOM
Sweet dreams, Joey.




He's gone!


Did you get a trace?


(on phone)
Yeah, we got him.


(smiling)
Good.



Joey takes a disk out of his computer and stashes it in an
air vent in the cieling.



Phreak, Dade and Cereal are rollerblading through the
halls of an apartment building that is filled with
graffiti. It appears that most of the spray-bomb art was
created by the residents.


Nice place, huh.

Cereal knocks on a door spray-painted "Hackstock"


You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You
know who he is?


(surprised)
No, don't know who he is.
(to Cereal)
Do you?

Cereal shrugs.

A hooded black man in his early twenties answers the door.


Nikon! Lord Nikon this is...

Phreak motions to Dade.


(finishing)
Crash Override.


Never heard of you. Done anything?


No.

Nikon slams the door.


Come on!

Phreak knocks the door again. Nikon opens again.


What, your mom buy you a 'Puter for Christmas?
(to Phreak)
Does he know anything?


Sure man, he's elite.


(pausing, checking Dade out)
Come in.


Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your
place tonight?


(removing his hood)
Again?
(pauses, then grins broadly)
Yeah sure.

Nikon and Cereal do a fake Kung-fu move together.


Ooka-pow!



Later, the four are watching TV. On TV is a secret
service agent giving a news interview.


(on TV)
Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public
and privately owned computer systems,
infecting them with viruses, and stealing
materials for their own ends. These people,
they are terrorists.


Agent Richard Gill, You're hacker enemy number
one, man. You're a boner!


Yo, showtime, showtime!


What's going on?

ALL BUT DADE
(in unison)
4...3...2...1...

Cheesy music plays. Razor and Blade, androgynous asian
brothers, have a community access TV show. "Wayne's World"
in eye liner.


Welcome to our show!


Hack the Planet!

ALL BUT DADE
Hack the Planet!


For those late night hacks...


Jolt Cola! The soft drink of the elite
hacker.


Who are these guys?


That's Razor and Blade.


Razor and Blade.

Now Razor and Blade have a disconnected payphone in their
studio.


That's right, this IS a payphone.

RAZOR AND BLADE
(in unison)
Don't ask.


As you can see, this is just a simple
microcassette recorder. (shows the
microcassette recorder)  Hook it up to the
phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.


Record the tones that the coins make. And
hang up and get your money back!


And never again have to pay for a service that
would be dirt cheap...


...IF it weren't run by a bunch of
profiteering gluttons!


Remember, hacking is more than just a crime.
It's a survival trait!



Joey is taking a shower, wearing walkman headphones,
singing along with the music. Joey finishes, turns off
the shower, still singing. He draws open the shower
curtain to find two secret service agents with shotguns
pointed at him.


SS AGENT
FREEZE!


What? What? What did I do? What?

The agents drag Joey, still naked and wet, out of the
shower and into the living room. His mother is
hysterical..

JOEY'S MOM
Joey!


Get in there! Sit down!

ANOTHER AGENT
Stay down there. Don't move.

Joey is pushed into a sofa. He sees his computer, "Lucy",
being carried away.


Lucy!

Joey dives onto the agent carrying Lucy away, losing his
towel.  His mother, seeing his exposed buttocks, is
shocked.

JOEY'S MOM
JOEY!!!



A police-type vehicle pulls up. It's Agent Richard Gill
of the Secret Service.  He stops a young agent for an
update.


How's it going, Ray?

AGENT RAY
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted
hard drive.


In English, please. I didn't spend ten years
protecting the president so I could finish my
career feeling like an idiot.

AGENT RAY
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so
we don't think he had time to erase his
computer files.


Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up
here, and take him in for interrogation.

AGENT RAY
Alright sir.

They split up.  A reporter and her sound man run up to
Gill.


Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your
time?


Why of course, Jennifer.

While Jennifer conducts the interview, agents lead Joey
into an unmarked car. His mother is behind him, still
hysterical.

JOEY'S MOM
Joey!


Mom...


Just how dangerous are hackers?


Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate
public and privately owned computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

JOEY'S MOM
Joey!


...and stealing sensitive materials for their
own ends. These people, they're terrorists...

JOEY'S MOM
Joey!



A tall, impressive building. A cavernous atrium filled
with busy people.



A handsome looking woman in her late thirties walks in.


Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I
see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.


(to Margo)
Once again, don't call me Eugene.
(to the board)
A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a
superuser acount, giving him access to our
whole system.


Precisely what you're paid to prevent.


Someone didn't bother reading my carefully
prepared memo on commonly used passwords.
Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for
most used passwords are love,
(gesturing lewdly)
sex, secret and...
(eyeing Margo)
...God. So would your holiness care to change
her password?

Margo just blinks prettily.


A hacker planted the virus.


Virus?


Yesterday, the ballast program for a
supertanker training model mistakenly thought
the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.


Excuse me?


(as if to a child)
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted
in the Gibson computer system claimed
responsibility.


What, it left a note?

Plague hits a button on a remote control, and the virus -
a long haired male model - appears on a large screen, in
psychedelic colors. The virus speaks in a hammy Italian
accent.


Unless five million dollars are transferred to
the following numbered account in seven days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
fleet.

BOARD MEMBER
Is that...


(interrupting)
That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The
problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and
we don't know which ones are infected.

DUKE ELLINGSON
Well then, put the ships' ballasts under
manual control.


There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These
ships are totally computerized. They rely on
satellite navigation, which links them to our
network, and the virus, wherever they are in
the world.


So what are we supposed to do?


Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented
security officer. I traced the hacker's call.
The secret service picked him up this morning.
I'll just search his files for the original
virus code, and then I can eliminate it.



Plague, Margo and two suits from the boardroom are riding
down an escalator.

SUIT #1
Now look, now we expect you to get onto this
right away, yeah?


Yeah!

SUIT #1
Well, how soon?


Well, we're working on it as fast as we can.
This is a very common occurrence in
corporations as large as ours. You have
nothing to worry about.

SUIT #2
Yeah, right.

SUIT #1
Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?


Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100
percent. Okay?

SUIT #2
Yeah.

SUIT #1
Okay.


We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.

The suits get off the escalator, Plague and Margo take the
next one down.


What the hell was that all about?


I had to move fast. The hacker copied my
garbage file.


What?


I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in
the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the
hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we
can't do on our own.


I don't want to go to jail for this.


Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.


But you've created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to
arrest some hacker kid?


Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.


Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...


Sh, sh sh sh sh.

Plague stops a passing secretary and snatches a piece of
paper from her hand.


I'll take care of this.


Alright, sir.


I can cancel it any time. I don't need any
program code. But it's the perfect cover, to
confiscate the disc and find out how much of
that garbage file has been copied.


Get it!
(walking away)
Why did I ever trust you?
(going back up the escalator)
Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your
toys.




Joey is distraught over the dismantling of Lucy. Agent
Ray examines the Mac's innards.


Did you find the program for the virus on any
of the discs we confiscated?


No. He's either very smart or very stupid.


Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an
accomplice. We'll release him until his
indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see
if he leads us to your disc.



Joey's apartment building is an L-shaped skyscraper about
30 storeys high, unimpressive by New York City standards.
Two Secret Service agents are staking Joey out in a car
outside.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB
Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's
apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still
grounded... by his mother.

His radio crackles.

AGENT BOB
Listen to this bullshit.
(he reads)
"This is our world now. The world of the
electron and the switch, the beauty of the
baud. We exist without nationality, skin
color, or religious bias. You wage wars,
murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us
believe it's for our own good, yet we're the
criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is
that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is
my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You
may stop me, but you can't stop us all."

AGENT RAY
Now that's cool.

AGENT BOB
Cool?

AGENT RAY
Yeah, cool.

AGENT BOB
You think it's cool?

AGENT RAY
(not caring for where Bob is going
with this)
It's cool!

AGENT BOB
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!



Dade, Cereal and Phreak check their faces. Cereal brushes
his teeth.


(to Phreak)
So what do you think, can I crash at your
place tonight?


What is it with this guy?


His parents missed Woodstock and he's been
making up for it since. Hey, you hear about
Joey's bust?


Yeah. Probably had something to do with that
bank in Idaho.


Do you think he could hack a Gibson?


Did you talk to him?


Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next
three lifetimes.
(imitating her)
He isn't to consort with his computer friends.
(te, you're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

Kate barely acknowledges him.


(cynically)
Humm, yeah.

Curtis leaves.


(mockingly)
Right.


The sensitive type.

Kate finally notices that Dade, whom she didn't invite, is at her
party and in her bedroom.


What is he doing in here?


Relax, Burn, he's my guest.


Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of
OTV!


What?


I'm Crash Override.


You're the moron that's been invading my turf?


Whoa, whowhowhowhoa.
(motioning to Dade)
Crash...
(motioning to Kate)
and Burn!

Cereal breaks into hysterics.




Plague is hacking.


Murphy kid turn you down?


(in a hammy southern accent)
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper
and penetrated the FBI NCIC.


Pervert! What are you talking about?

She turns her back to him. He does up the zipper on her
dress. Their relationship becomes apparent.


The FBI computer holds files on twenty million
Americans.  I just hacked into it.


Congratulations.


From here I got access to every piece of data
ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His
parents separated five years ago, reconciled
two years later, filed for divorce last year,
custody battle, boy chose to go with his
mother. Hmm.


So?


So, we get the mother, we get the boy.





Kate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in
to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own,
some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back
in.


What the hell are you doing?


It's cool, I'm just looking.


It's too much machine for you.


Yeah?

Dade starts working furiously on it.


I hope you don't screw like you type.

Dade slows to a two-finger keypoke, not missing a beat.


It has a killer refresh rate.


P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.


Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI
bus. But you knew that.


Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change
everything.


Yeah. RISC is good.

They uncomfortably exchange glances.


You sure this sweet machine's not going to
waste?


Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the
Best, Die Like the Rest?"


Yeah.


Are you challenging me?


Name your stakes.


If I win, you become my slave.


(intrigued)
Your slave?


(realizing his mind is in the
gutter)
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack
copyrights, whatever I want.


And if I win?


(giggles)
Make it my first born.


Make it our first date.


You're not gonna win.


And you have to smile.


I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so
you're on.


MONTAGE: Scenes of Dade and Kate preparing for the challenge.


(voice over)
So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To
hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill, and
get one back for Joey.

Dade spray paints camouflage onto his keyboard.


Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1.
No appeals.

Kate rifles through her address book.


The duel will last until we declare a winner.

Dade plays quick-draw with disks.


Use only the dialups, access codes and
passwords in your collection. Can't ask for
any help from us.

Dade, having mastered the quick-disk-draw in the mirror,
looks satisfied.


(into mirror)
Talking to me?

All five are together at the beginning of the challenge.


Any questions?


Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?

Dade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins.



At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
"Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
hackers look on.



A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,
sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is
Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the
MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
horror.



Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
changes an ad.


Alright, he's in the personal ads.
(reading Dade's ad)
"Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
for discreet friend to bring dreams to
reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
Transvestites welcome."



At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone
responding to the ad.


I... I... I know where you can stick it... I
know where you can stick it...

Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes
on.


...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick
your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I
wanna lick your ankles...


Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.

Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.


That's why they call me Stallion...


Aw, that's disgusting!

Gill punches another button.


My heart is steaming for you...

Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.


...spank you with my...


Aww, Spank your ass...

He punches another button.

Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,
disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,
witnessing the whole thing.


Animal!




It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
offender status to Gill's record.



Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
grunt.  He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
handcuffed.


Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
know who I am?



Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."





(on phone)
This is accounting, sir. You enquired about
an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?


Yes.


Our records indicate he's deceased.


I'm what?




The five are playing pool.


Dead.


Dead?


Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.


Very impressive.


Super hero like even.


Yeah, whatever. What's the score?

Phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says 60 - 60.


Tie.

The other four protest.


Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and
everything, I guess you two will have to
improvise the next round.


Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our
date.


And if I win, so do you.

Dade thinks about it a second.


Deal.

Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to
that."




A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a
zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands
caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body
belongs to Dade Murphy.

Kate wakes up gasping.  It was only a dream. She pants
and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed
that dream.


Oooohhhh...





Kate, at her locker, stops Dade.


Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.

She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and
bikini bottom.


You are man enough to stick with the deal,
aren't you?

Dade walks off.




Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He
takes the package.


Thanks.

He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop
computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very
high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns
it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.


You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well
let me explain the New World Order.
Governments and corporations need people like
you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard
cowboys. And all those other people out there
who have no idea what's going on are the
cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my
help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,
think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!
Tell me where the disk is.

Plague's face vanishes.




Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking
despondent. His mother enters.

JOEY'S MOM
You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not
grounded anymore.

She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to
life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it
in the air vent.




Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.


Yo, what's up?


Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file
from...


Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it,
Joey, come on.


Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.


Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.


I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're
asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
look for me?

Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
and Phreak notices.


Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.

Joey sees, and runs for it.


Shit!

The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
Phreak.




Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a
condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it
there with gum.




Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking
career. He knows he's about to be busted.


DREAM SEQUENCE.

The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He
still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically
going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.


I'm watching you...



A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.

PHREAK'S MOM
Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano.
Time for school, come on.

The secret service bursts in through the window just as
Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps
to his feet.


Secret Service, don't move!


Deja vu!

AGENT BOB
Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping
Phreak, cursing in Spanish.


What are you waiting for, arrest me already!




The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened
thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he
is led to his one phone call.


You get one call. Uno. Understand?

The cop locks the dial on the phone.

Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He
starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a
ringing tone.


Hello, operator services.


Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a
number.


What number please?


555-4202.


Just one moment.


Thank you.

Kate answers.


Hello?


Hey, it's me.


Phreak?


I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He
really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the
disc with a file he copied and now I'm in
jail! They're charging me with some serious
shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do,
like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and
they keep asking about you guys.


You think they're going to bust us?


Yeah! You better figure out what's on that
disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that
place where I put that thing that time?

He hangs up just as the cop returns.




Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the
boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the
condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from
the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.



Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.


Hi!
(looking Kate over)
Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
(she shows them to Dade's room)
Dade... you have company.


It's a nice room.


We need your help.


Do my ears deceive me?

Kate starts to leave.


Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up
call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand
free access to data, well, it comes with some
responsibility. When I was a child, I spake
as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
as a child, but when I became a man I put away
childish things.
(pause)
What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse
11, no duh. Come on.


Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need
your help to figure out what's on this disc.


I can't. Everybody who touches that thing
gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,
I'm sorry.


Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
something.

Cereal leaves the room.


What is it with you? I know we've been
playing games, but, we're supposed to be on
the same side and we really need your help. I
really need your help.


I'm sorry, I can't.


Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
And just hide it in case we get busted, so we
have something to give our lawyers, something
that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
that?

A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.


Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in
the fridge. Cereal has.

She leaves.


(to Mrs. Murphy)
Thank you.


Okay. I'll copy it.


Okay, thank you.


Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's
records on his screen.


The girl. The girl has the disc I need.


I told you, I don't play well with others.


Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
file.

Dade does.

An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's
picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into
Dade's mother.


Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,
two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
When she's arrested, she will not have a
trial, she will not pass go, she will go
directly to jail. Then I change this file
back to the original, and your mom disappears.


That's bullshit.


What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,
she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip
searched.


You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.


Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse
things than death and, uh, I can do all of
them!

Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked
mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over
her.




Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.


Talk to me.


I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
You leave her alone.


Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?

Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives
by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
but gives up quickly.




Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the
disc.


Kate, listen.


Uh, hold on...


I have to tell you something.


Hold on a second!


Look at this, it's so lean and clean.


Looks like a hacker wrote it.


Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.

Nikon points out part of the code.


But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This
is taking forever and a day to figure out.
I'm gonna make some coffee.

Dade takes Nikon's place.


Tag, you're in.

Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the
garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about
anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of
half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.


This isn't a virus. It's a worm!


What's this one eat?


It nibbles. You see this?

Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.


This is every financial transaction Ellingson
conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to
the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.


The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.


And no one's caught it because the money isn't
really gone. It's just data being shifted
around.


Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.


Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out. By this point, it's already
running at, what, twice the speed as when it
started.


Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...


Two days.


And judging by this segment alone, it's
already eaten about...


21.8 million bucks, man.

Nikon whistles.


Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and
that's us. We've got to get the rest of the
file, so we can find out where the money is
going before the worm disappears, so we can
find out WHO created it.


I know, I know who wrote it.


What?


This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a
copy of the disc you gave me.


You what?


I didn't know what was on it.


(agitated)
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!


Yo, man, you an amateur, man.


Why did he come to you?


I got a record. I was Zero Cool.


Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven
systems in one day?

Nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory.


Biggest crash in history, front page, New
York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought
you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero
Cool! Oh, shit!


That's far out!


This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!


(coldly)
Well that's great. There goes MIT.


I'll make it up to you!


How?


I'll hack the Gibson.


They'll trace you like that
(snaps his fingers)
man, cops are gonna find you, they're
gonna find you with a smoking gun.


Fucked if I care, man.


Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll
take you ten minutes to get in, and you've
still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the
cops will have you in... five minutes.


Oh wow, we are fried.


(suddenly lighter-hearted)
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With
me, we can do it in seven.


You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.


Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help,
we can do it in five minutes, man.


Okay. Let's go shopping.


Woo hoo! Boom!




Dade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into
a dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.


You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of
honor, I might take advantage of this
situation.  Erotically, as it were.

Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye
contact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They
start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a
security guard.


Alright, hold it right there!

Kate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security
guard.  He ducks.


Shit!!


It's my subway defense system.




Nikon is staring down a manhole, Cereal is fishing through
an adjacent phone company truck.


He's way down there.

Cereal emerges with a beltload of equipment and a hard hat.
But he forgot the most important thing.


Ta-da!


Yo, brain dead, the manual!

Cereal goes back to the truck and gets a thick manual. The
phone company technician comes up from the manhole.

PHONE COMPANY TECH
Hey!

CEREAL AND NIKON
(in unison, pointing down the street)
TRUCK!!!

The phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and
Nikon take off.




A woman is seated at the desk.  Agent Gill walks by.


Find it?

Cereal emerges from the desk, between her legs. His tool
belt dangles obscenely from his crotch.


Phone's alright. The problem must be
somewhere else.

Cereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing.




Nikon poses as a flower delivery boy. He winds his way
through the offices of Ellingson Mineral, "shoulder
surfing", watching the workers entering passwords. His
photographic memory captures everything.  The Plague walks
past him, noticing briefly but not making the connection.



The Da Vinci virus' launch/cancel prompt is up.


(pacing)
They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
How much do they know?


Not everything. But enough to implicate us.


You said the worm was untreaceable!


Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers.
But don't worry. All we have to do is launch
the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be
put away.


Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!


No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the
time they realize the truth, we'll be long
gone with all of our money.

Margo starts to protest.


Look, there is no right and wrong.  There is
only fun and boring. A thirty year prison
sentence sounds pretty dull to me.  Who do you
prefer serves it, us? Or them?

Plague clicks on "Launch". The virus repeats its demand.


Unless five million dollars are transferred to
the following numbered account in seven days,
I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
fleet.



As the virus speaks, a supertanker sails on a choppy sea.



Plague leaves a message on Gill's answering machine.


(sternly)
The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30,
and those hackers tried to get into our system
again. At this point I insist you take more
strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will
hold the Secret Service responsible.

Gill gets on the phone.


(grimly)
Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias
Acid Burn, Emmanuel Goldstein, alias Cereal
Killer, Dade Murphy, alias Crash Override,
also known as Zero Cool, and Paul Cook, alias
Lord Nikon. We pick them up tomorrow morning
at nine o'clock.

As Gill gives the order, a mysterious device under his
desk blinks. Cereal put it there.




Nikon and Cereal taped Gill's orders.


Snoop onto them...


...as they snoop onto us.

Nikon calls Kate.


Yeah, it's Kate.


Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.




Cereal, Nikon, Dade and Kate skate through a run down
subway platform and get on the "A" Train. They go over
the results of their password gathering spree.


Alright, so what have we got?


Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.


Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how
many but... my head hurts.


Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the
Da Vinci virus?


What?


Check this out. It's a memo about how they're
gonna deal with those oil spills that happened
on the fourteenth.


What oil spills?


Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the
thirteenth.


Well this hasn't happened yet.


Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same
day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci
virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was
being charged with? Look...
(quotes the memo)
"Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson
tankers" - they blame hackers!


(angry)
Damn!


A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.

Kate gets ready to get off the subway.


Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going,
huh?


I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right,
till we get arrested. So just stay low. I'm
gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay?
(to Dade)
Are you coming?

Dade gets up.


May the Force be with you, man.




Weird music plays, lots of weird people dance.  Razor and
Blade are on stage, dancing in front of a huge speaker.


There they are!


Razor and Blade! They're flakes!


They're elite! Let's get 'em.

Dade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to
a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the
stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the
stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is
thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead.

Finally the crowd lets him go.  He catches up with Kate.


I lost 'em. Where were you?

Dade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words.

They make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's
lair. Video monitors are everywhere.


I don't like this.

A robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at
Dade.


AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!


(through video intercom)
What do you want?


Ummm... we come in peace?

Dade winces at his own corniness.


We need your help.  If you're up to it.


She's buff. Ballsy.


Let's keep her.


Waste the dude.

The gun goes off. It's only a cigarette lighter! No one
can accuse Razor and Blade of not having a sense of humor.





A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills
at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.


It's somehow connected with the worm that's
stealing the money.


We need your help to overload the Gibson so we
can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the
worm program.


She's rabid, but cute.


See, we're very busy. A TV network that
wishes to remain nameless has expressed an
interest in our show.


(noticing the stench of sellout)
Let's go, Kate.


Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to
need more than just two media icons like us.
You need an army.


That's it! An electronic army! If I were us,
I'd get on the internet, send out a major
distress signal.


Hackers of the World, Unite!


How are you going to take care of the cops?

Dade just smiles.



Dade hacks into the city traffic light control system.
Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York
City.



Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews.
Cereal's beeper goes off. It displays the message:

GRAND CENTRAL
HACK THE PLANET


Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand
Central. Let's hit it!

Nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave.

Dade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets.
Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green,
runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in
morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant
gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while
the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a
parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off.



The four hackers skate into Grand Central Station and head
to the lowest level. They meet up with Joey.


Hey Joey, you made it!



The hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay
phones.  Dade is wearing a "Pirate Eye" eyepiece.


Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us
time, we have to get into Plague's file and
copy the worm.

Cereal screams.


Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was
a little tension breaker, that had to be done,
alright?


Cereal.


Yeah?


Go fix the phones.


Roger.

Cereal takes off to fix the phones.


Joey, take his place.


What, me?


Take his place, man, do it. You can do it.

Joey takes Cereal's place.


Ready?


Yeah.


Alright, let's boot up.

The four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens
come up on the laptops. They begin to hack. We see the
inside of the Gibson. Viruses of all kinds begin to pour
in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the
Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye
patches appear on their screens. "Sit on my interface."
"Shit for Brains." "Arf Arf Arf!" Cookie monsters.




The big monitor shows the attack in progress.


What is it? What's wrong?


Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.


"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a
major catastrophe.

The main screen is filled with:

I WANT A COOKIE. GIVE ME A COOKIE NOW!


There's a new virus in the database.


What's happening?


It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I
do?


Type "Cookie", you idiot. I'll head 'em off at
the pass.

Another virus appears.


We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and
overlay files.


Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!

The systems display comes up. Red flashes everywhere,
signifying new attacks. Plague presses a key.


Die, dickweeds!


The rabbit is in the administration system.

Rabbit icons start to fill the systems display.


Send a Flu-shot.


Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.


A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file,
then it spreads like cancer.


Cancer?

The Da Vinci Virus sings "Row Row Row Your Boat".
Tanker ballasts start filling - for real.






It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.


Man, there's too many garbage files, I need
more time.






They're at Grand Central Station, lower level.
Don't screw up.





The Secret Service and NYPD are stuck.  They turn around
and head for Grand Central Station.



The public phone next to Dade's rings.  Dade answers.
It's The Plague.




Game's over. Last chance to get out of this
without a prison sentence.  You're not good
enough to beat me, you little shit.




Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.





Give it up! Just give it up.




Kate's phone rings. It's Razor.


Are we fashionably late?


Hackers in England, Italy, Japan, Russia, everywhere
mobilize and start attacking the Ellingson Gibson. The
English hacker looks and talks suspiciously like Annie
Lennox's husband. Our heroes relentlessly search for
the right garbage file.





We have massive infection.  Multiple GPI and
FSI viruses.


They're coming in from remote nodes. They're
going after the Kernal!


Colonel who?


The System Command Processor, it's the brain.


Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?

Duke Ellingson arrives.

DUKE ELLINGSON
Belford, what's going on?


In short, Duke, a shit storm.




Dozens of armed Secret Service and SWAT troops push
through the crowded station looking for the hackers.


INSIDE THE COMPUTER.

The garbage file lights up.  The familiar psychedelic
swirl of equations and fractal graphics returns.





I found it! I found it!





This is the end, my friend.
(smiling sickly)
Thank you for calling!




Dade is disconnected.


Oh, shit! He got me.


Joey's getting stupid busy.

The SS and SWAT are still closing in on the hackers.


Joey. I need you to drop your viruses, go
after the worm. You're the closest.

The SS and SWAT push through crowds.


It's root slash period workspace slash
period garbage period.

The SS are nearly there.

Joey has found the file.

The SS arrive.  Gill himself has his .357 drawn.


Freeze!

It's an empty bank of payphones, the receivers are linked
together and taped up. No hackers. They keep going.


(pissed off but determined)
Ahhh Come on!

Joey completes the download.


(to Razor and Blade)
Kill the Gibson.


Roger that.





Come on you son of a bitch, is that all you
got, huh? Come on, let's see what else you
can do! You talking to me? Huh? Hahahaha.
Are you nuts? Come at me!

Margo and Duke are awed by Plague's imminent failure and
total unprofessionalism.


They're in the kernal.

DA VINCI VIRUS
Help... me...

The Da Vinci virus dies. The tankers stop capsizing and
right themselves.


(off screen)
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

SOMEONE ELSE
(off screen)
Ballast tanks are emptying. It'll be okay.


The main screen lights up:

ARF ARF!
WE GOTCHA!

MESS WITH THE BEST
DIE LIKE THE REST



Little pissant!

The Gibson dies in a flash of light.



The hackers cheer and congratulate each other.


Yes!


We did it!


Let's get out of here!


FREEZE!

The SS have caught up with the hackers. Agent Bob seems to
be choosing which pore on which hacker's face to blow away
first. Only Joey thinks to put his hands up.

As they are led away, a handcuffed Dade surrreptitiously tosses the
disc with the worm into a trashcan.



Outside, he notices Cereal, who wasn't present to be
arrested. He yells to the crowd, but really is
addressing Cereal.


They're TRASHING our rights, man! They're
TRASHING the flow of data! They're TRASHING!
TRASHING! TRASHING! HACK THE PLANET! HACK
THE PLANET!


Shut up and get in the car!


(understanding the hidden message)
HACK THE PLANET! HACK THE PLANET!




Later, Cereal is trashing through the garbage cans in
Grand Central Station. Eventually he finds the disc.
To Cereal's disgust, it has gum stuck to it.





Gill phones The Plague to report the successful takedown.


Hello?


We caught 'em.


Good.


Red handed! You won't be having any more
trouble from them.



At Plague's place, Plague and Margo toast with champagne,
giggle, and then scurry off to bed...




Dade and Kate are there.


Me, alright? I did it. She knows shit about
computers. She... she's just my girlfriend.


(laughing)
I suggest you modify your attitude. Because
you are floating. And I'm about to flush your
ass.

The intercom beeps.


You've got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir.

Gill leaves.


Are you crazy? What are you doing?


I'm trying to help you.

She pauses, realizing his gesture.


Dade.


What?


Thanks for your help.

Dade turns on the intercom. Gill can be heard through it.


(grimly)
Your son is in big trouble. He has violated
his probation and he has engaged in criminal
activity.


My son happens to be a genius. He understands
something happening today that you won't
comprehend if you live to be a hundred, and he
would never use what he knows to harm a living
soul.

Agent Bob enters.

AGENT BOB
The news crew you requested is here.


Oh good. Cause I have a few things to tell
them.


Your son is facing thirty felony counts in an
ongoing investigation. You face possible
arrest if you do that.


Mister, I don't care if I face certain death.


Mrs. Murphy stays right here.


Oh, wow, she's great.


Yeah.



The news crew interviews Gill.


...and attacked the Ellingson's computer
network. Is the last we've seen of this type
of high-tech espionage?


Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave
threat to the national security. This
incident just proves without a doubt that we
need increased funding to stop...

Nikon and Joey are led in.

The monitors cut into static, then Cereal appears.


That kid cut him off!


Hold on, boys and girls. It is I, the Cereal
Killer, making my first coast to coast, world
wide, global television appearance. Yes,
that's right, I'm here to tell you about this
heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson
Mineral.

Razor and Blade busily work on keeping him on the air.


But for what, you ask? World domination?
Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called
Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause
Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be
blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was
really the smokescreen, right. What could be
so vitally important to protect that someone
would create such a nasty, antisocial, very
uncool virus program?

Cereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in Times
Square.


But why? Could it be to cover the tracks for
this worm program? A worm that was to steal 25
million bucks. The password for this hungry
little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, head
of public relations at Ellingson Mineral...




Margo watches this and sits bolt upright in bed.


Oh my God!


(continuing)
...and Eugene Belford, Computer Security
Officer.





(finally understanding what's been
going on all along)
Son of a BITCH!


(continuing)
What's this? Is this the unnamed account in the
Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I
think so!

An account number scrolls below Cereal's chin.


Yo. I kinda feel like God!

His voice echoes across the earth and among the
satellites.


Plague?
Eugene?

Almost supernaturally, Plague is already gone. He was
right next to her, stark naked in bed a second ago.



The hackers embrace and congratulate each other again,
Lauren Murphy hugs her son.



Margo Wallace has been arrested, and is being led into the
women's lockup. Some of the other women grab at her
expensive Italian leather jacket as she is led to her cell.


I don't even know how to work a VCR, let alone
a computer! Get off! Look, listen, I'll make
a deal. Eugene Belford! I know where his
mother is, I promise you. Get offa me! I need
a lawyer!





Here you are, Mr. Babbage.  Flight time to
Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I
get you anything else?

"Babbage" is The Plague in disguise; he now appears about
60 years old.


Just a pillow please.

The pillow slides in behind his head, he reaches up to
adjust it.


Thank you.

A handcuff snaps onto his wrist. It's Gill.


You're welcome.


What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess!
I'll never fly this airline again!




Dade and Kate are on their date. Dade is smartly,
somewhat androgynously dressed. Kate is heavily made up,
and yes, she is wearing a dress.


You look good in a dress.


You would have looked better.


Wanna go for a swim?




Dade and Kate swimming, fully clothed, in a pool on a
roof.


I can't believe they decided you won.


They didn't. The guys felt it was the only
way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty
good. You're elite.


Yeah? You know if you would have said so in
the beginning, you would have saved yourself
a whole lot of trouble.

They look out at the skyline. Suddenly, the lights in
three buildings change. They spell out:

C         B
R    A    U
A    N    R
S    D    N



Kate laughs, honestly impressed.


Beat that!

Kate continues laughing.


You know, I've been having these really
weird..


(finishing his sentence)
Dreams?

They kiss passionately.

The credits roll.

Dade and Kate emerge from their underwater kiss, the view
rises above the pool and into the night.  Fade to black.
